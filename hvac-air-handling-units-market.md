<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Air Handling Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Draw Through Type</li><li>Blow Through Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the HVAC air handling units market, two primary types are the draw-through and blow-through configurations. Draw-through units pull air through the fan and into the heating or cooling coils, promoting efficient air filtration and temperature control. Conversely, blow-through units push air through the coils before entering the fan, often resulting in reduced noise levels and enhanced air distribution. Each type serves specific applications, influencing energy efficiency, maintenance requirements, and overall system performance in commercial and industrial environments.</p></p>
