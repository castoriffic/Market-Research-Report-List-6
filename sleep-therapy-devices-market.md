<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleep Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)</li><li>BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)</li><li>VPAP (Variable Positive Airway Pressure)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sleep therapy devices primarily include CPAP, BiPAP, and VPAP machines. CPAP delivers a consistent air pressure to keep the airway open during sleep, making it effective for obstructive sleep apnea. BiPAP provides two levels of pressure: higher during inhalation and lower during exhalation, catering to patients needing varying support. VPAP, a variation of BiPAP, adjusts the pressure based on the patient's breathing patterns, offering a more customized approach. Together, these devices play a pivotal role in managing sleep-related breathing disorders.</p></p>
