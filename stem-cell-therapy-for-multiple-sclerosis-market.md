<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell therapy for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an innovative treatment approach targeting the neurodegenerative nature of the disease. The market is primarily segmented into two types: intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration. Intravenous stem cell therapy involves delivering stem cells directly into the bloodstream, promoting systemic benefits and potential migration to the central nervous system. In contrast, intracerebroventricular therapy administers stem cells directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, providing a more localized treatment option that may enhance efficacy in targeting affected brain regions.</p></p>
